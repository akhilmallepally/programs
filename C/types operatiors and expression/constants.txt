1234 =  int

1234l  = long int

12.34 = float

037 = octal 

0X12 = hexadecimal

0X1l2  = long octal    or hexademical????

'x' = character constant



defining a constant in a C program :

1 :    const float Pi = 3.14     - This is done in the code. Everytime the occurance of the Pi in the program, it feched the data from the declared constant

2 :    #define Pi 3.14     - This is done by the preprocessor. While the program starts executing, it doesn't ask to fetch data from Pi, by defaults it replaces with the number.
