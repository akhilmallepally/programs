In case of exressions(a +b )   Convert the smaller(less bits) operand so that we don't loose data.


long to small based on size ( check on the machine once too)
long double > double > float >short > char


In case of assignments we will convert the left had side to right hand side
a = b  ( There may be loss of data, we should be careful while assigning)

For example (loss of data) :
char c;
int i;
c = i  
8  16  ( Here the 32 bit variable is assigned to a 16 bit one which results in the loss of data)

(no loss) :
char c;
int i;
i = c;
16  8



We can also do this conversions explictl. It is called as type casting

f = (float)10    () - operator in the line is called casting operator
i = (int)23.5
